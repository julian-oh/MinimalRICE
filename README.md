Minimalistrice, a ... rice by me (Juliano)
=========================================

This is a little rice that I've "developed" throughout my usage of **GNU**/Linux.

This RICE is heavily inspired/based from Luke Smith's v/LARBS, so inspired that I've also moved to *Void* just to try it out. I uploaded this because I am actually in the process of moving from Arch Linux to Void Linux and I want to back this up just in case.
